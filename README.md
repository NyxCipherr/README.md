# NyxCipher

NyxCipher is a technical collective focused on intelligence-oriented workflows,
OSINT methodologies, and system-level thinking.

This profile does not represent an individual.
There is no public leadership, hierarchy, or attribution.

Work shared here reflects structure, methodology, and direction
rather than implementation or tooling.
